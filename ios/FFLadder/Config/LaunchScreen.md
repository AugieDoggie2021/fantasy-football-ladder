Launch Screen Setup (Xcode):

1. In the project settings, select the app target → General → Launch Screen.
2. Choose a color/image from Assets.xcassets (e.g., AccentColor) or create a launch storyboard if desired.
3. Keep it lightweight to minimize launch time; a solid gradient or brand color is recommended.
